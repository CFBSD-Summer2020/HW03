## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library("ggplot2")
```

```{r}
immune<-read.csv("immune.csv", col.names=c("type","Cd3e","Cd19","Cd14"))
```

```{r}
ggplot(immune, aes(type,Cd19,fill=type))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_jitter(size=0.1)+
  annotate("rect", xmin=0.5, xmax=1.5, ymin=0, ymax=15, alpha=0.2)+
  annotate("rect", xmin=6.5, xmax=7.5, ymin=0, ymax=15, alpha=0.2)+
  annotate("text",x=4, y=12.5, label="Cd19 seems to be a
good marker for B cells", size=3) +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(ncol=2)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,vjust=0.5),legend.position="none")+
  labs(title="Boxplot of relative Cd19 expression among different mouse
samples",x="Mouse sample",y="Relative Cd19")
```
