## Graphing the orientation of campylidia with respect to water flow

In this assignment, I will plot a histogram of campylida orientation with respect to water flow on a polar coordinate system using ggplot + coord_polar.

This was part of my undergraduate research project when I worked on [lichens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen). To learn more about the project and campylida specifically, you can check out my [undergrad paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26993971/)
