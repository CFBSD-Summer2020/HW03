## Assignment
Read in some data and graph something in R

For this assignment, my goal was to make some graphs illustrating the progression of COVID in the U.S. over time. To make the graphs, I used the raw data posted to the [NY Times Github repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).

**Here is the link to my [code](HW03_US_data.Rmd) and [markdown](HW03_US_data.md)**
