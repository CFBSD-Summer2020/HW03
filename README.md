## Assignment

Sorry for the simplicity of the plot. This actually is for my lab meeting on Tuesday (I hid the names of the proteins I'm working with though!).

## The data

The data I used come from two separate FPLC runs: both correspond to the same pair of proteins that are supposed to form a complex, but were prepared in two slightly different ways (hence the differences observed). They curves are called chromatograms and show absorbance at 280 nm over time/elution volume. 

## Code

The code's very simple. One thing worth mentioning is that I ended up using fread() function to import the workbook (I learned about it from DataCamp) that requires installation of "data.table" package.

Here's the acces to the [code](https://github.com/violecule/HW03/blob/master/Script%20for%20AKTA%20plots.Rmd)...

## Markdown

... and the [Markdown]() file, where you can hopefully see my plot.
