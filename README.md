# HW03

Hello, a lot of my graphs and the data itslef is in prism files that I no longer have acess to so I shall simply recreate an excel graph that I used to have autogenerate from ELISA data. 

[this](https://github.com/abockhughes/HW03/blob/master/example%20graph.png) is the graph! 

and [this](Graphing-HW03.md) is the new graph!
