# HW03
Hi!

I decided to go with Idea #2 and made a simple graph with coronavirus data from the NYT repository. I decided to use markdown, and in the document you can see the detailed explanation of what I did. Here is the [code](https://github.com/lcespedesarias/HW03/blob/master/HW03-Import-and-Graph.Rmd) and here is the [markdown](https://github.com/lcespedesarias/HW03/blob/master/HW03-Import-and-Graph.md)

Best,

Laura
