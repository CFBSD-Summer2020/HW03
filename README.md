I forked the NYT repository for Covid-19 cases and made a graph showing how the number of cases rose during the month of March. I chose March since at the beginning there was a relatively low amount of cases in the US.The file I took the march cases from is seen [Here](us_allmonths.csv). I then took all the data from March and put it into this [file] (usmarchcovid.txt) My code for the graph can be found [here](DataImport.Rmd). I uploaded the image of the graph which can be seen [here](covidgraph.png). It's a simple graph and it could definitely be better, but I was a bit busy with some other things.
