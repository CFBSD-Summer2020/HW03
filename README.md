#Homework 3

#I did not have personal data relevant to this assignment so I took the data from [Gapminder](gapminder.com/data/) regarding the generation of nuclear power, per person in several countries. I then used this data to compare the relative proportions of power produced in North and South America (Europe had too many countries!). I believe I accomplished what I set out to do. However, I think the code could be neater. I also had to do quite a bit of reformatting of the original data file to get it to read the way I wanted within R.

#Let me know your thoughts.
