Idea #2: There are a ton of statistics on COVID cases and the increase over time. Try remaking one of those? You can even use [NY Times's Github Repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) and download the raw data from there!

I decided to go with this idea since the data from when I was in lab was mostly images, so not a lot of numerical data to work with.

For the graph, I decided to take a look at Covid cases at the county level in Texas because I wanted a state with lots of counties, and several big cities to compare to its more rural areas.

Looking at the Covid data was really interesting, but time-consuming. The NYT GitHub page only gives counties, cases, and deaths. To get some more interesting information out of that, I had to go get it myself. Then, I had to make an Excel sheet that I could use for graphing, which required a decent amount of trial-and-error. Hopefully future lessons will help make this process easier - and maybe the extra work I did this week will be helpful later on. :)
