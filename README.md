# HW03
## Assignment
Read in some data and graph something in R

### My data

[Here is a link to my code.](R_script_HW03.R) Alternatively you can select R_script_HW03.R from my repository.

The code reads in some data from an excel sheet included in the repository, called "Conv_data_for_HW03.xlsx". (Sorry, couldn't figure out how to link to that as above for the R script.)

Cheers
