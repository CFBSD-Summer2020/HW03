Idea #2: There are a ton of statistics on COVID cases and the increase over time. Try remaking one of those? You can even use [NY Times's Github Repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) and download the raw data from there!

I decided to go with this idea since the data from when I was in lab was mostly images, so not a lot of numerical data to work with.

For the graph, I decided to take a look at Covid cases at the county level in Texas because I wanted a state with lots of counties, and several big cities to compare to its more rural areas.
