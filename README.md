## Assignment
Read in some data and graph something in R

The data I used is the national data and state data from [NY Times's Github Repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).  
I tried to produce two graphs using ggplot to briefly show the growth of cases and deaths of COVID-19 in the U.S. as a whole and in several states that have the most cases up until today.
