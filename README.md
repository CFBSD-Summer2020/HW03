# HW03 - Daniel Krochmal
## Assignment

You will find the completed assignment under this link: ![HW03_YiiP](HW03_YiiP.Rmd). To complete this assignment I plotted chromatograms from purification of several YiiP-antibody complexes, that I performed a few months ago. The purification was successful, but far from perfect - but this makes for a better plot to play with in this assignment. You'll find a more detailed description in the linked file.
