## Description 
I chose to create a panel of line plots of daily snowfall and z-score of daily snowfall by date (Jan 1st to Mar 31st) in the 9 counties with highest recorded daily snowfall during 2010-2016 period. I created these graphs because I would like to investigate the changes in daily snowfall in these counties and find out a reasonable threshold to determine extreme snow storm. The raw snowfall data was pulled from the [National Climatic Data Center](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access) website. I did the data cleaning and manipulation in SAS 9.4.
