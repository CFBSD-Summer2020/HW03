## Assignment
In this assignment, I chose to plot some COVID-19 data from the NYT 
[NY Times's Github Repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).

I downloaded two datasets, one is for the COVID-19 cases and deaths in the US from Feb 2020 to July 2020. The second one is COVID-19 cases and deaths by each States.
