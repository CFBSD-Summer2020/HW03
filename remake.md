## HW03: Microtiter plate graphs remake

As is described in [Readme](README.md), the purpose of the project is to
examine the expression of CDSes upstream and downstream the **coupling
sequence**. The expression of the entire operon is regulated by the pLac
promoter, which is induced by IPTG (Isopropyl
Î²-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside).

## Step 0: Data manipulation

This step is done in Excel. The raw microtiter plate data comes in pure
text, and contains **3 measurements**: fluorescence in the wavelength of
green, fluorescence in the wavelength of red, and the absorption at 600
nm. We use the following equation to normalize the fluorescence signal:

  
![
Fluo\_n = \\frac{Fluo - Fluo\_{empty}}{Abs - Abs\_{blank}}
](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AFluo_n%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BFluo%20-%20Fluo_%7Bempty%7D%7D%7BAbs%20-%20Abs_%7Bblank%7D%7D%0A
"
Fluo_n = \\frac{Fluo - Fluo_{empty}}{Abs - Abs_{blank}}
")  

where *Fluo* means fluorescence and *Abs* means absorption. *empty* are
the wells innoculated with cells but are not supplemented with the
inducer chemical(IPTG here). *blank* are wells with only buffer. I used
*uncertainty propagation* to achieve the standard deviation of
normalized fluorescence signal.

## Step 1: import data from Excel

First, load the packages:

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)
library(latex2exp)
```

Then, use `readxl` functions to read Excel data:

``` r
rfp <- read_excel("microtiter_data.xlsx",
           col_types = rep("numeric", 8),
           sheet = "RFP_processed")

gfp <- read_excel("microtiter_data.xlsx",
           col_types = rep("numeric", 8),
           sheet = "GFP_processed")

str(rfp)
```

*RFP* stands for Red Fluorescence Protein, which represents the red Fluo
signal. *GFP* ditto.

## Step 2: Plot fluorescence signals against time

After the spike of the inducer, the number of fluorescence proteins in
cells is expected to increase, until it hits a plateau (a stationary
phase).

Below are two separate graphs dealing with RFP signals and GFP signals.
In the original design (see the dataframe structure above), I treated
CP1, CP2, and CP3 as different columns, which refer to different designs
of coupling sequences. In order to make faceted graphs, I used `rbind`
to stack these columns into a new dataframe.

``` r
# To make faceted graphs, CP1, CP2, CP3 columns will has to be merged
nrow = nrow(rfp)

cp1_extract <- rfp[, c("Time", "CP1", "CP1.std", "Inducer")]
colnames(cp1_extract)[2:3] <- c("Value", "Std")
cp1_extract$CP <- rep("CP1", nrow)

cp2_extract <- rfp[, c("Time", "CP2", "CP2.std", "Inducer")]
colnames(cp2_extract)[2:3] <- c("Value", "Std")
cp2_extract$CP <- rep("CP2", nrow)

cp3_extract <- rfp[, c("Time", "CP3", "CP3.std", "Inducer")]
colnames(cp3_extract)[2:3] <- c("Value", "Std")
cp3_extract$CP <- rep("CP3", nrow)

cp_extract <- rbind(cp1_extract, cp2_extract, cp3_extract)

ggplot(cp_extract, aes(x = Time, y = Value, color = as.factor(Inducer))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = Value - Std, ymax = Value + Std)) +
  labs(color = TeX("Inducer\nconcentration/$\\mu$M"),
       x = "Time/h", y = "Fluorescence/AU", title = "RFP vs time") +
  facet_wrap(vars(CP), scale="free_y") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

  facet_wrap(vars(CP), scale="free_y") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

Yes, as you can see, there are some quite discomforting error bars at
the beginning of the red fluorescence signal measurements. Also, this
part the signal is lower than the empty group, which is likely to be an
error in the measuring process. Thus, for the RFP measurement, we only
used data sampled **after 4 hours**.

Also, these plots are not the same ones as the old graphs from README.
My initial goal was to imitate those plots, but that would actually
require more knowledge in data wrangling. For this assignment, I just
plot these fluorescence signals against time.
