## Purification of bacterial zinc transporter YiiP-antibody complex

YiiP is a 70-kDa, dimeric bacterial zinc transporter. In this assay I
attempted to purify YiiP in multicomponent complex that consists of:

  - YiiP with fusion partner and in a nanodisc
  - Fab1 - an antibody fragment that specifically recognizes YiiPâ€™s
    fusion partner
  - protein G mutant - that recognizes Fab1 with high affinity
  - Fab2 - another antibody fragment that recognizes Fab1-protein G
    complex, and contains a mutation preventing it from being recognized
    by another protein G)
  - nanobody - specific to Fab1 and Fab2

This whole complex is intended for cryo-EM analysis. Although the
structure of YiiP transporter has already been obtained with X-ray
crystallography, it would be interesting to see if the whole
Fab/nanobody/protein G part helps in the analysis of data collected with
cryo-EM, by helping in correct orienting of the particles by the
analysis software.

The purification was successful, but not very efficient - three large
peaks on the right correspond to different antibody complexes, but they
miss YiiP protein. Much smaller peaks on the left correspond to the same
complexes, but with YiiP being present.
